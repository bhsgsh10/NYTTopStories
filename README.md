# The New York Times Top News Demo
This app provides a demo of the Top News API of The New York Times. It is aimed to showcase the implementation of UITableView using UITableViewDiffableDataSource and NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot. Currently the app only displays a list of story titles and their author names. The focus is entirely on getting Diffable Data source to work as mentioned in WWDC 2019. 

The project will be expanded to provide a better experience for NYT's top stories. The code will also be cleaned up and modularized as we move along, and will transition from MVC to MVVM architecture.
